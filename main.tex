\section{Intro to Git} \label{Intro to Git}
\subsection{What is Git?}
Git is a very common VCS (Version Control Software) that you will see in industry. Git has an emphasis on speed, data integrity and distributed workloads. All VCS systems generally have a similar goal of tracking changes in files and storing data on a remote server.

You can learn all about git through their official website \href{https://git-scm.com/}{https://git-scm.com/}. The book "Pro Git" is also completely free to view through your browser \href{https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2}{https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2}.

What you will be learning in this guide is basic git commands which will help you properly store your code on a remote server, and remotely upload your code to the lab computers. This will also help you track milestones in the project so you can revert any changes or go back to a period of time that you know the project was working :).



\section{Using Git with Windows} \label{Using Git with Windows}
Windows does not have a git client by default, so we will need to download software for that. This guide will utilize the popular \emph{git for windows}, or better known as Git Bash.
\subsection{Git Bash}
\subsubsection{Installation} \label{Win10-GitBashInstall}
Enter the website \url{https://gitforwindows.org/} and click "Download". Once the download is finished, open the installer. All of the default options are good, sane options, so just keep clicking "Next" Until the installation is done.
\subsubsection{Using Git Bash}

When you are finished downloading Git Bash from Section \ref{Win10-GitBashInstall}, you can open up Git Bash by typing in "git bash" after pressing the windows key. Upon pressing enter, you will be greeted with a terminal that looks like the Figure~\ref{fig:win_06_Git_Bash}.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{win_06_Git_Bash.PNG}
    \captionof{figure}{Git Bash Default Screen}
    \label{fig:win_06_Git_Bash}
\end{center}

Now that you are in the terminal, you can use any commands that any usual bash terminal would have. You can enter the following command \textbf{(do not type the \$ at the start of the command)}:

\begin{lstlisting}
$ echo $PWD
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=3in]{win_07_echo_PWD.PNG}
    \captionof{figure}{Printing CWD in Git Bash}
    \label{fig:win_07_echo_PWD}
\end{center}

Figure~\ref{fig:win_07_echo_PWD} shows the result of running the above command. The result is "/c/Users/mitch". /c/ refers to the hard drive. "Users/mitch" refers to the path on that hard drive. The reason that you see the yellow tilde (that is the $\sim$ character), is that \textbf{$\sim$ is shorthand for "/c/Users/mitch"} (your username will show up instead of mitch).

You can change your directory into a folder where we can clone our repository. For this, we will be using the \textbf{cd} command. You can think of \textbf{cd} as standing for "Change Directory". Execute the following:

\begin{lstlisting}
$ cd Documents/
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=3in]{win_08_cd_Doc.PNG}
    \captionof{figure}{Changing Directory to Documents}
    \label{fig:win_08_cd_Doc}
\end{center}

Figure~\ref{fig:win_08_cd_Doc} shows the results of changing our directory to Documents. You can now note that the yellow text says "$\sim$/Documents" which is actually referring to "/c/Users/mitch/Documents" in my case because the name for my User is mitch.

Let's create our own directory called 'git' in $\sim$Documents. This is where we will clone our git repository to be used for later.

\begin{lstlisting}
$ mkdir git
$ cd git
\end{lstlisting}

now you will be located in $\sim$/Documents/git. From here, let's clone a reference repository just to test everything. Execute the following command to clone an example repository with some Verilog code.

\begin{lstlisting}
$ git clone https://github.com/mitchdz/ExampleVerilogCode
\end{lstlisting}

now if you execute the command:

\begin{lstlisting}
$ ls -l
\end{lstlisting}

you will see that the new directory 





\begin{verbatim}
$ git commit -m 'init commit'

*** Please tell me who you are.

Run
eww
  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"

to set your account's default identity.
Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.

fatal: unable to auto-detect email address (got 'mitch@DESKTOP-AJ9NBNN.(none)')
\end{verbatim}


\section{Creating your own Github Repository}
There is a lot of software that utilizes git such as GitHub, SourceForge, Bitbucket and GitLab. For this guide we will utilize Github. To get some cool bonuses for being a student you can even register for the student pack at \href{https://education.github.com/pack}{https://education.github.com/pack}.
